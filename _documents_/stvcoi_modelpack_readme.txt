Version: v1.0

-----------------------------------------
DESCRIPTION:
These are various environment models created for the "Star Trek Voyager: Conflicts of Interests" mod for EF2. Since the mod has unfortunately been cancelled, the models made for it are being released for anyone else to use.

Pack consists of models for Defiant and Voyager.
List of models:
- Defiant - Captains Chair and side consoles
- Defiant - Bridge Chair
- Defiant - Conn
- Defiant - Medkit
- Defiant - Stool
- Defiant - Transporter Console
- Voyager - Console (3 variations)
- Voyager - Engineering Chair
- Voyager - Laptop and 2 PADDs
- Voyager - Messhall chair and tables
- Voyager - Turbolift

Also included are the source files (Max5 model files and Photoshop PSD texture files) for all models. My texturing skills are fairly bad, so feel free to redo as you please. Some of the textures are made by Explorer (LCARs and light shaders).
I have left the textures as TGA despite the large file sizes. I thought I'd leave it up to you whether you wanted to convert it to DDS for a smaller file sizes. You can do this via a program called "DDS Converter" (available on EFFiles).

You'll notice that for each texture there is another file of the same name with a "tex" appended to it. These "tex" files are useful for creating textures as they can help you identify how the texture will get wrapped on to the model. 

NOTE: Before you distribute the files, make sure you remove unneeded files (for example, all the texture PSD files, the MS3D(Milkshape) files, the "tex" files, and so on).

***PLEASE*** If, for whatever reason, you want to convert this to another game, or use it as part of another mod then give me (or Explorer, depending on what textures you use) credit (it'd be nice to email me as well just so I know that it's of use to anyone :))
